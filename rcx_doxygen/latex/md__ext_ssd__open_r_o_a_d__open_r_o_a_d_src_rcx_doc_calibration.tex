A. Running Open\+R\+CX {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{generate__patterns_8tcl}{generate\+\_\+patterns.\+tcl}}} to generate layout patterns.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input\+: tech L\+EF
\item Output\+: {\ttfamily patterns.\+def}, {\ttfamily patterns.\+v}
\item Script\+: {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{generate__patterns_8tcl}{generate\+\_\+patterns.\+tcl}}}
\item Desc\+: Open\+R\+CX generates many pattern geometries to model various types of capacitance and resistance (i.\+e., multi-\/conductor) geometric configurations.
\end{DoxyItemize}

B. Running your favorite extraction tool (i.\+e., reference extractor) to extract parasitics of the layout patterns.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input\+: {\ttfamily patterns.\+def}, {\ttfamily patterns.\+v} (if required), and additional files required by the reference extractor.
\item Output\+: {\ttfamily patterns.\+spef}
\item Script\+: Not provided
\item Desc\+: Extract parasitics of the patterns generated by Open\+R\+CX using a reference extractor. This one-\/time step provides the parasitics of various types of pattern geometries as reference for fitted per-\/unit length R, C calculation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

C. Running Open\+R\+CX to convert {\ttfamily patterns.\+spef} to RC tech file.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input\+: {\ttfamily patterns.\+spef}
\item Output\+: RC tech file
\item Script\+: {\ttfamily generate\+\_\+rules.\+tcl}
\item Desc\+: Open\+R\+CX takes the {\ttfamily .spef} from the reference extractor and performs calculations to produce capacitance and resistance tables for a wide range of wire geometries. The output of this flow is a custom RC tech file for Open\+R\+CX.
\end{DoxyItemize}

D. Benchmarking -\/ test the accuracy of Open\+R\+CX on the patterns layout.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input\+: {\ttfamily patterns.\+def} and RC tech file
\item Output\+: {\ttfamily rcx.\+spef}, {\ttfamily diff\+\_\+spef.\+out}
\item Script\+: {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{ext__patterns_8tcl}{ext\+\_\+patterns.\+tcl}}}
\item Desc\+: Perform parasitic extraction on pattern layout for the calibration using the generated RC tech file. Open\+R\+CX then compares the extracted parasitics with the golden parasitics that had been extracted by the reference extractor in Step (B) above.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Go to Open\+R\+CX home directory ({\ttfamily ./\+Open\+R\+O\+A\+D/src/rcx}).
\item Navigate to calibration folder {\ttfamily cd calibration}
\item Modify the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{user__env_8tcl}{user\+\_\+env.\+tcl}}} script in the script directory.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item T\+E\+C\+H\+\_\+\+L\+EF\+: points to the directory of the tech L\+EF
\item P\+R\+O\+C\+E\+S\+S\+\_\+\+N\+O\+DE\+: the technology node
\item ext\+Rules\+: the name and the location of the Open\+R\+CX tech file
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Run the executable script {\ttfamily run.\+sh} -\/-\/$>$ run Steps (A) through (D) of the flow above.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily source run.\+sh} or {\ttfamily ./run.sh}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The Open\+R\+CX RC tech file can be found in the directory that is specified in the ext\+Rules variable.
